            <h1>Assignments​</h1>
        <p class="centered">Assignments are one of the four major features of CyberSpace​.
            <br>
            Assignments is a place for students to see classroom recordings, classwork, homework and quizzes, along with a place for teachers to review and grade work​
            <br>
            CyberSpace Assignments are faster, easier to use, and better than those of Teams and others, and here is how...​</p>
        <h2>Quick Assign</h2>
        <p class="centered">From the Teacher's POV, they can create classwork and homework​
            <br>
            They can attach instructions and files, and edit due dates​
            <br>
            Teachers can see what time the student submitted the assignment, as well as if it was late, incomplete, or missing.​
            <br>
            This might look a lot like Microsoft Teams, and that is because it is. But unlike Teams, the Assignments tab also has plenty of other features​</p>
        <h2>Quizzes</h2>
        <p class="centered">Teachers can create quizzes and assign them to students.​
            <br>
            They allow the teacher to create multiple choice, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank questions.​
            <br>
            If the window is not open for a set amount of time, the teacher is alerted and can fail the student. This can also be done automatically.​​</p>
        <h2>Grades</h2>
        <p class="centered">Students could automatically see their course grades in CyberSpace​
            <br>
            Teachers could see all of the student's grades in the class​
            <br>
            Assignments inside each classes grades can be attached with comments from teachers as well as if the assignment was graded, and the amount of points it was worth​
            <br>
            There is an added feature that shows the amount an assignment affects a student grade. ​
            <br>
            It can be adjusted to show what a grade would look like if an assignment was worth more points, if it received a higher or lower grade, if it was graded or not graded, etc.​
            <br>
            This also includes being able to see what would happen if you got a new assignment rather than changing the grades of an old one​
            <br>
            At the end of all quarters, a report card will be generated.​</p>
