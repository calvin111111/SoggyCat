                <br>
                Meetings are one of four major features of CyberSpace.​
                <br>
                Meetings are your all-in-one improved channel for to make online classes more interesting​.
                <br>
                Meetings are extremely easy to set up and work with, here is how...​</p>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p class="centered">Ever had the wrong meeting link, or forgotten to change the meeting settings? With CyberSpace Meetings, these problems will disappear. ​
                <br>
                Meetings utilize a channel that can be joined at specified times, making meeting links unnecessary. (Similar to Discord Voice Channels)​
                <br>
                For middle and high schools, students can chose to be automatically sent to their next period's meetings after the previous one ended​
                <br>
                Meetings also have extended features that keeps students participating and engaged</p>
            <h2>Hand Raising​</h2>
            <p class="centered">Meetings are easily managed by teachers. Other than having the essential mute/unmute start/stop video, we also have a better hand raising system​
                <br>
                Teachers can enable hand raising when they want to, and students raise their hands just by clicking the raise hand button​
                <br>
                Teachers call on people by clicking the hand icon on the student profile and once called, all held hands go down so they don’t stay up at other times​
                <br>
                Rather than hands popping up next to participants in order from the fastest hand raise, teachers can see who got called on the least, and generate more participation from students​
                <br>
                This participation number can also been seen on participants not raising their hands, so if those raising their hands have been called on to many times, teachers can choose a random person who has no participated​</p>
            <h2>Automatic Attendance​</h2>
            <p class="centered">The teacher is provided a list of students who are in the class​.
                <br>
                As students join, they will be marked as present​.
                <br>
                People who join late will be marked as tardy with a note for when they joined​.
                <br>
                People who don’t attend the meeting for more than a set amount of time marked absent​.
                <br>
                The teacher can also edit attendance manually.
                <br>
                Students receive a notification if they were tardy or absent, and can respond to the notification, and explain why they were late or absent.​</p>
            <h2>Staying on Task​</h2>
            <p class="centered">It is up to the teachers whether or not students are required to have cameras on. However, even with their cameras on, there is a significant possibility the student is distracted by other applications on their device.​
                <br>
                CyberSpace has built in AFK Detection, notifying a teacher if a student is particularly disengaged, by detecting if the teacher-selected windows are not in focus. ​
                <br>
                If they are for a long period of time, it will notify the teacher, and the teacher can remind the student to stay on task or make them prove they are active</p>
