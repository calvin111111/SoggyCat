            <h1>Calendar​</h1>
        <p class="centered">The calendar is one of the four major features of CyberSpace.
            <br>
            The calender is used not only for tracking days but also for tracking events and deadlines.
            <br>
            You can change the priority of the events​
            <br>
            Notifications could also be customized​
            <br>    
            It also helps remind people what classes they have next​.</p>
        <h2>Main Calendar</h2>
        <p class="centered">The Main Calendar is a general area for important dates​
            <br>
            The Main Calendar can be viewed in different ways, like day, week and month​
            <br>
            Day View will show what classes will occur at what time of day. It also shows upcoming quizzes and homework due dates that day​
            <br>
            Week View shows when homework is due that week, and upcoming quizzes that week. Holidays and Breaks will also be shown​
            <br>
            Month view contains the same features as Week View, but obviously, it is shown on a monthly scale​​​</p>
        <h2>Task Board</h2>
        <p class="centered">One part of the calendar is the Task Board​
            <br>
            Task Board is sorted into sections: Not done, doing, and done, where in each section, you can put assignments​
            <br>
            Assignments and quizzes will be automatically added to the task board, as well as the assignment dates and due dates being put on the main calendar​
            <br>
            Reminders will be given out at reasonable times (ex. 1 day, 1 hour, 15  min, 5 min before due date) or custom times.​
            <br>
            You can also add personal notes to the Task Board​</p>
