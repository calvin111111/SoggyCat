            <h1>Social​</h1>
        <p>The Social section is the third of the four major features of DigiRoom​
            <br>
            Socializing is essential for students. Being able to socialize, especially when everyone is online, can connect students and encourage them to make friends​
            <br>
            The Social section is for student interpersonal interaction with other students. Students can use the Social section to chat and call with other students​
            <br>
            Ever feel like your chat app is running on someone's grandma's Chromebook? DigiRoom chat runs on powerful servers resulting in less sending time.</p>
        <h2>Chats</h2>
        <p>Firstly, chats can be created between students, teachers, and can have multiple people inside​
            <br>
            They can be used by students to quickly consult their teachers, or ask another student for help.​
            <br>
            Chats include free voice messaging, as well voice calls​
            <br>
            Teachers could configure automatic moderators to check for certain inappropriate phrases or spam and delete them or prevent the student from chatting​
            <br>
            This helps prevent and bullying and harassment​​</p>
