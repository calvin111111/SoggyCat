            <small><i>Shown above: our revolutionary chatting technology, allowing students to communicate near-instaneously!</i></small>
            <br>
            The Social section is one of the four major features of DigiRoom​.
            <br>
            Socializing is essential for students. Being able to socialize, especially when everyone is online, can connect students and encourage them to make friends​.
            <br>
            The Social section is for student interpersonal interaction with other students. Students can use the Social section to chat and call with other students​.
            <br>
            Ever feel like your chat app is running on someone's grandma's Chromebook? DigiRoom chat runs on powerful servers resulting in lowered messaging delay.</p>
        <h2>Chats</h2>
        <p class="centered">Firstly, chats can be created between students, teachers, and can have multiple people inside​.
            <br>
            They can be used by students to quickly consult their teachers, or ask another student for help.​
            <br>
            Chats include free voice messaging, as well voice calls​.
            <br>
            Teachers can configure automatic moderators to check for certain inappropriate phrases or spam and delete them or take other administrative action.
            <br>
            This helps prevent and bullying and harassment.​​</p>
